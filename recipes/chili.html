    <p>
        This is one of my favorite recipes for anytime of the year. 
        I typically prepare it vegan but feel free to add a ground
        meat if you want. This dish is packed with protein and it 
        fills you up. Don't feel the need to follow the recipe too
        closely. It's chili... it's hard to mess up. Don't overthink it.
